        <!--<span class="post-content"><p>A painting hangs in my younger daughter’s room: it’s a picture of the spines of 10 books. These are books that her mother and I imagine her reading by the time she is 18. One she’s heard aloud many times: <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em>. Some others she might hear aloud in a few years: <em>Matilda</em>, <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</em>. Others I hope she will read on her own: <em>Graceling</em>, <em>The Disreputable History of Frankie Landou-Banks</em>, <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>.</p>

<p><img src="http://appratt.com/assets/tenbooks_800px.jpg" alt="painting with the spines of ten books" title="The ten books" /></p>

<p>One of the books I’d never read myself, until now: <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em>. I’m glad it’s there, and it occurs to me that at a certain point, she might ask about it, along with all the others. What will I say to her about the book spine with the splendid mysterious title by Ursula Le Guin?</p>

<p>“It’s a story about how men and women are both very different and somewhat similar”, I might say, if she is still young. “But it’s also a story about a man who flies very far away in a spaceship to a planet where everyone is both a man and a woman, and he tries to make friends with the people there. And by trying to make friends with the people who are both men and women, he thinks a lot about how people like us and like him—who are often boys or men or often girls or women—how we often treat each other in ways that don’t make sense, or are unfair or wrong, just because of some silly ideas about men and women. And the place where all this happens is cold. Really, really cold and snowy and covered in giant rivers of ice.”</p>

<p>An imperfect summation, but parenting seems to consist of a lot of imperfection.</p>

<p>If someone older asked me about <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em>, I might say that two themes of the myriad strands running through the book stand out for me. First is the interrogation and destabilization of the man/woman dualism that is perhaps the first oppressive dualism that we apply to children. The narrator Genly Ai explains the social structures on the planet Winter like this:</p>

<blockquote>
	Consider: There is no division of humanity into strong and weak halves, protective/protected, dominant/submissive, owner/chattel, active/passive. In fact the whole tendency to dualism that pervades human thinking may be found to be lessened, or changed, on Winter.
</blockquote>

<p>Second, there is the question of how space-faring societies might go about connecting with one another. Ai, the protagonist and emissary to Winter, has traveled in hibernation at near light speed for 17 years from the nearest outpost of a collective of worlds called the Eukumen. His human friends and family are as a result aged and dead; time passed much more quickly for them while he speed across the galaxy. As the sole ambassador on the surface of this cold, remote world, what must motivate him as an explorer? What would it take—not just as an individual, but as an exploring society—to venture far out into the reach with such great intentions but so little to grasp onto, and try to convince alien peoples to trust that you did indeed magically speed across the stars, leap-frogging from one incomprehensibly different planet to another?</p>

<p>The loneliness Ai feels as a human locked into one gender (inhabitants of Winter refer to him as a “pervert”) is a mirror to his loneliness at the edge of the world(s).</p>

<p>But I also hesitate to say that those are the two big ideas, because there are several themes woven together, and while two stick out for me, I’m constantly wondering if my own biased view as an Earthing human man is what makes me see those themes in boldface. After all, my own identity affords me a kind of freedom that is still unique in Le Guin’s universe. On Winter, every person has a monthly sexual cycle that turns them, temporarily, fully into a man who can impregnate or a woman who can be bear a child. No one has a choice about which role they take when in a state of “kemmer”—it is random each time. Again, Ai reflects:</p>

<blockquote>
	Consider: Anyone can turn his hand to anything. This sounds very simple, but its psychological effects are incalculable. The fact that everyone between seventeen and thirty-five or so is liable to be (as Nim put it) “tied down to childbearing,” implies that no one is quite so thoroughly “tied down” here as women, elsewhere, are likely to be—psychologically or physically. Burden and privilege are shared out pretty equally; everybody has the same risk to run or choice to make. Therefore nobody here is quite so free as a free male anywhere else.
</blockquote>

<p>As the partner permanently performing the male role in a hetero human relationship, I’ve spent the months and months of my partner’s pregnancies and the years of my young children’s lives trying to empathize with how childbearing structures who you are and who you can be in American society. But who would I be if I were the one who could get pregnant? Would I feel less free? Probably. Strange and disarming to imagine that not through a story where men instead of women can bear children, but through a story where the “burden and privilege,” and the work, of childbearing is spread across the entire society.</p>

<p>I suspect I would feel very much as Ai feels. “One is respected and judged only as a human being,” says the narrator, “It is an appalling experience.” Even in my progressive liberal skin, how could I not feel that an equalizing of social responsibilities feels at the same time like a lessening of my privilege?</p>

<p>So the book is dense with ideas like this, but bundled in a compact story that I feel is a hallmark of Le Guin’s style. Indeed, she made an argument in a 1986 talk that the very structure of a novel can be to simply act as a container holding a variety of ideas together. The anti-imperial shape of a novel, she argues, is that of a bag. The talk, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/subject/art/lit_crit/works/leguin/carrier-bag.htm">
“The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction,”</a> is both worth reading and quoting at length (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
The novel is a fundamentally unheroic kind of story. Of course the Hero has frequently taken it over, that being his imperial nature and uncontrollable impulse, to take everything over and run it while making stern decrees and laws to control his uncontrollable impulse to kill it. So the Hero has decreed through his mouthpieces the Lawgivers, first, that the proper shape of the narrative is that of the arrow or spear, starting here and going straight there and THOK! hitting its mark (which drops dead); second, that the central concern of narrative, including the novel, is conflict; and third, that the story isn't any good if he isn't in it.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<strong>I differ with all of this. I would go so far as to say that the natural, proper, fitting shape of the novel might be that of a sack, a bag. A book holds words. Words hold things. They bear meanings. A novel is a medicine bundle, holding things in a particular, powerful relation to one another and to us.</strong>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
One relationship among elements in the novel may well be that of conflict, but the reduction of narrative to conflict is absurd. (I have read a how-to-write manual that said, "A story should be seen as a battle," and went on about strategies, attacks, victory, etc.) <strong>Conflict, competition, stress, struggle, etc., within the narrative conceived as carrier bag/belly/box/house/medicine bundle, may be seen as necessary elements of a whole which itself cannot be characterized either as conflict or as harmony, since its purpose is neither resolution nor stasis but continuing process.</strong>
</blockquote>

<p>Her larger argument here is that the male-centric, imperialist theories of anthropology and literature alike privilege the kids of stories that emphasize maleness, and the attendant ideas of heroism, violence, and empire. In contrast, she attaches to an alternate anthropological theory: that rather than the spear as the important object in human evolution, we ought to consider the “carrier bag” that enabled prehistoric people (likely females) to forage for food and bring it back to the hearth.</p>

<p>While there is conflict, and a narrative arc, and a conclusion to Ai’s story on Winter, those pieces, those concepts in the carrier bag, are not there to achieve stasis or harmony. They are in “continuing process.”</p>

<p>I love Le Guin’s analysis of literature nearly as much as I love her literature, and I’m reminded of another observation from an essay about the history of fantastic literature, <a href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/reference/wcircle/leguin.pdf">“The Critics, the Monsters, and the Fantasists.”</a> “The literature of imagination, even when tragic,” she writes, “is reassuring, not necessarily in the sense of offering nostalgic comfort, but because it offers a world large enough to contain alternatives and therefore offers hope.”</p>

<p>I think about Ai, alone on Winter, and maybe that’s where his hope comes from: being out on the very edge of the imaginable. I think about the oppressive ideas that privilege men—who can’t do the amazing and magical thing that is bearing children!—in societies around our planet. But imagining what a world might be like where the burdens and rewards are more equitably spread across society, that gives me hope as well.</p>

        </h1>
        <span class="post-meta">March 30, 2017</span>
        <!--<span class="post-content"><p>Kendi lays a few deceptively simple building blocks as the foundation for this definitive history of racist ideas. First is how he defines a racist idea: “it is any concept that regards one racial group as inferior or superior to another racial group in any way.” It doesn’t matter if that idea is implied or explicit, state or unstated, inscribed in law or deed. If someone says that black people ought to be more like white people in any way, the implication is that black people are less and whites are more—and that is simply racist. Apply that rule to everyday discourse, to media representations of white and black folks, and to laws and policies and create disparities in wealth, incarceration rates, and educational access, and you see a world pulsing with racist ideas like radioactive contamination.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1440457523l/25898216.jpg" alt="cover of Stamped from the Beginning by Ibram Kendi" title="Stamped from the Beginning by Ibram Kendi" /></p>

<p>Second, he identifies three lines of argument about racial difference that have been in constant tension for the past seven centuries or so. Segregationist ideas deal in white supremacy and non-white inferiority; segregationists blame the problems of black people on black people or blackness itself. Assimilationist ideas blame the problems of black people on both discrimination and on black people; the classic “lift yourself up by the bootstraps” argument suggests that black people can exert effort to counter the weight of discrimination, but of course also implies there was something wrong with blackness to begin with. Antiracist ideas reject all of that: there is nothing wrong with black people–they are worthy of love, respect, and power.</p>

<p>Third, Kendi inverts the traditional narrative that hate and hateful people produce racist ideas. The history many people have been fed is that hate or ignorance is what produced racist ideas and that those ideas then led to everyday discrimination. He demonstrations over 700 years of history the exact opposite. His formula: “Racial discrimination–&gt;racist ideas–&gt;ignorance/hate: this is the causal relationship driving America’s history of race relations.” Moreover, “racially discriminatory policies have usually sprung from economic, political, and cultural self-interests, self-interests that are constantly changing” (pg 9). In this way, the actions of powerful individuals and groups create discrimination, and that discrimination generates racist ideas, which make other individuals and groups come to hate people of color. If the discrimination serves a particular economic or cultural interest, then that discrimination is what generates the lies and nonsense that are the grist of racist ideas, and those that ingest that poison become hateful and fearful.</p>

<p>Individual people, acting alone and in groups, make specific decisions to discriminate on the basis of race. In so doing, they generate racist ideas that fuel hate. Individual people with political, economic, and social power create racist ideas. For a very long time, the creation of those racist ideas was overt and blatant. It is now largely covert. Understanding the history of those racist ideas is critical to understanding the history of the United States. If you’ve visited the National Museum of African American History and Culture, then it becomes crystal clear that the history of racist ideas is the essential story of the United States. This book adds immense depth to that ongoing story.</p>

<p>But if racist ideas are made by individuals wielding power, they can be unmade. Knowing where they came from is an important place to start.</p>

<p>Kendi’s clever organization loosely follows five individual lives and the intellectual milieu sounding their ideas about race. So while the first section, on protestant political writer Cotton Mather, begins in the 1630s, it also reaches back to explain the origins of western racist ideas. Aristotle concocted a climate theory of race in the 4th century BCE, arguing that people in hot climates were incapable of the superior culture, science, and politics of cooler climates, namely his home of Greece. The Romans leaned on this climate theory of race to justify slavery within their empire, and then St. Paul described a human hierarchy in his letters, canonized in the New Testament. Puritans like Mather imported these ideas from Europe to America. but hundreds of year earlier, a Muslim writer in Tunisia, Ibn Khaldun, laid out a climate theory in his 1377 history, The Muqaddimah. He asserted that sub-Saharan African nations where “submissive to slavery,” but added the idea that darker-skinned people could physically assimilate in colder climates: their skin would lighten as they moved north, he claimed. But the climate theory Khaldun championed was in tension with an even earlier “curse theory” of racial difference based upon verses in the book of Genesis saying that God laid a curse upon Noah, marking the lineage of his son Ham as dark-skinned people. Climate theory allowed Islamic and Christian slavers alike to take captives of any color–including ethnic Slavs from around the Black sea–while curse theory would later become the driving idea behind the enslavement of black peoples alone.</p>

<p>A series of writers in the 15th and 16th centuries solidified the ideas that justified the expansion of the European slave trade. Gomes Eanes de Zurara argued that Prince Henry of Portugal welcomed the importation of slaves in order to turn them to “the true path of salvation.” Leo Africanus, himself a black Moroccan who was enslaved and later given to Pope Leo X, wrote a scholarly tract claiming that African nations were “beastly.” He passed off his denigration of African peoples as “truth” and demonstrated that racist ideas can spring from individuals of any race or skin tone.</p>

<p>So from the very beginning of this long line of racist ideas, we see individuals concocting ideas to serve a specific political or economic purposes. Classifying darker-skinned people as less than lighter-skinned people justified slavery, which made slave-trading empires immensely wealthy. Claiming that slavery could save the souls of captives reinforced the climate justification, and the “curse” theory also gave Christian slavers more intellectual fodder to bolster the economic arrangements that benefited their coffers. Cotton Mather’s consequential contribution, Kendi writes, was to lead “the way in producing the racist idea of Christianity simultaneously subduing and uplifting the enslaved African” (pg 75). Whites could defend their dominance and the oppression of black people using a version of Christianity that said their complexion made them better, but that their religion could recuse the souls of the people they enslaved.</p>

<p>Confusing? Just wait until Thomas Jefferson enters the scene. Kendi demonstrates that the writer of the Declaration of Independence was an extraordinary thinker in his ability to combine segregationist and antiracist ideas into the same sentence. Freed blacks could never be part of American politics, Jefferson wrote in <em>Notes on the State of Virginia</em>. Kendi quotes him: “Deep rooted prejudices entertained by the whites; ten thousand recollections, by the blacks, of the injuries that have sustained; new provocations; real distinctions which nature has made; and many other circumstances, will divide us into parties, and produce convulsions, which will probably never end but in the extermination of the one or the other race” (pg 108). In that jumble: the antiracist idea that whites have injured blacks, the segregationist idea that whites and blacks are differentiated by nature, a pro-slavery argument that abolishing slavery would be politically dangerous, and the antislavery idea that blacks could somehow be freed and then not allowed to be part of the state. Jefferson’s solution? Educate blacks, free them from slavery, and then send them back to colonize Africa. Kendi’s attempt to untangle the evolving contradictions in Jefferson’s writing, politics, and personal life is almost humorous, so contorted are the third president’s contributions to the bedrock of racist ideas in the United States.</p>

<p>During Jefferson’s time, Kendi also documents the crystallization of the racist idea of “uplift suasion” that would later underpin the “bootstraps” ideas that persist to today. Abolitionists argued that the eradication of slavery depended not on the ideas and decisions of whites, but on the behavior of freed blacks, who they thought should assimilated completely and adopt white culture, education, and conduct. In this way, white people who saw blacks behaving this way would be persuaded to drop their ideas that blacks were inferior. “The burden of race relations was placed squarely on the shoulders of Black Americans,” Kendi writes, a fact that persists into the present moment, and an important reminder to contemporary white allies that responsibility for undoing racism falls in large part to them, a fact long obfuscated by racist ideas like uplift suasion (pg 125).</p>

<p>From here, the historical trail Kendi follows is clear, infuriating, and an essential summary of the core ideas about who gets to be part of American society and who will be marginalized and exploited.</p>

<p>The section on abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison tracks the rise of anti-slavery ideas alongside the assimilationist ideas about black education, “soulfulness,” and returning to Africa. Kendi also captures the simple political expediency of Abraham Lincoln’s decision to empancipate slaves during the Civil War. The historian quotes the former president, who penned this in a Washington newspaper column: “My paramount objective in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery… If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union.” So just to be clear: Lincoln saw that Union as being for the white people, not for the millions of slaves freed by his decrees.</p>

<p>The long narrative woven around the life of W.E.B DuBois follows the thinker’s evolution from a proponent of uplift suasion to the anti-racism that marked his later work. Born during the Civil War, DuBois saw the advance of black political power during Reconstruction, the horrific violence and state oppression in the south that returned black citizens to conditions that mirrored slavery, and he died in 1963, the day before the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. The final chapters of this section capture an important counter narrative to the popular interpretation of how civil rights legislation advanced during the Kennedy administration. The terrible images of Bull Connor’s attacks, using dogs and fire hoses on black protesters in Birmingham, horrified and galvanized civil rights activists in the United States—but those same images, broadcast around the world to non-white, decolonizing nations severely hampered the Kennedy administration’s ability to develop credible diplomatic relations with those countries. The “domestic race problem,” in the words of a State Department official, damaged the U.S. reputation abroad. Kendi explains: “But not many inside (or outside) of the Kennedy administration were willing to admit that the growing groundswell of support in Washington for strong civil rights legislation had more to do with winning the Cold War in Africa and Asia than with helping African Americans.” Civil Rights legislation passed. American influence abroad continued to expand.</p>

<p>If the arc of ideas during DuBois’s lifetime bent towards racial progress, then the arc of ideas in the final section, organized around Angela Davis, clearly demonstrate Kendi’s observation that “racist policies could progress in the face of racial progress.” (He elaborated on that idea on the eve of Donald Trump’s inauguration in this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/opinion/sunday/racial-progress-is-real-but-so-is-racist-progress.html">New York Times column</a>.)</p>

<p>During her lifetime, Davis has been a target of the state’s repressive law enforcement apparatus, and she is still fighting to this day against political repression and incarceration of millions of people of color. During her lifetime, the most destructive segregationist and assimilationist ideas in American thought have shifted from the overt racism civil rights activists stared down in the 1960s to the “law and order” rhetoric that characterized conservative and Republican campaigns from Richard Nixon onward (and that Bill Clinton co-opted in the 1990s). In parallel, Kendi also unpacks how writers and thinkers like Davis pushed back against the layers of intersectional racism that doubly and triply repressed women of color, poor people of color, and queer people of color. Kendi quotes from Davis’s book, Women, Race &amp; Class: “racism has always been a divisive force separating black men and white men, and sexism has been a force that unites the two groups.”</p>

<p>In his closing, Kendi points out that his history is not merely of racist ideas, but of the failure of many strategies used over to time to counter that variety of racist ideas. “Self-sacrifice, uplift suasion, and educational persuasion” have all failed, he argues. That last idea, educational persuasion, is of particular interest to me, in part because I work in education and in part because I tend to read books like <em>Stamped From the Beginning</em> with the intention of gathering facts to share in service of educational persuasion. But Kendi knocks that down, returning to his original framework: ignorance did not lead to hate, then racist ideas, then racist policies. “In fact, self-interest leads to racist policies, which lead to racist ideas leading to all the ignorance and hate,” he writes. That was true for Gomes Eanes de Zurara and Prince Henry of Portugal; it remains true for the Republican state legislators in North Carolina who gerrymandered congressional districts “with almost surgical precision” to isolate black and Democratic voters.</p>

<p>So what to do? Kendi ends the book talking about power and the necessity to focus pressure, advocacy, and protest on those who hold it: “An antiracist America can only be guaranteed if principled antiracists are in power, and then antiracist policies become the law of the land, and then antiracist ideas become the common sense of the people, and then the antiracist common sense of the people holds those antiracist leaders and policies accountable.”</p>

<p>So that is the work.</p>

        </h1>
        <span class="post-meta">August 17, 2016</span>
        <!--<span class="post-content"><p>I was at a two-day race and equity workshop last fall, and during the final session of the first day, the lead facilitator read aloud several pieces of anonymous feedback that various participants had shared. “I want to hear more from the white participants,” she said, reading from a card someone else had submitted. Hearing that, something clicked for me: I was listening to the participants of color talk about race, and I was empathizing with their stories, thoughts, and emotions, but I wasn’t talking enough about my own race, my own story, and my own emotions. That withholding was, in fact, a facet of my own white privilege. The skin I was in meant that I didn’t have to think about race on a day-to-day basis if I didn’t want to. In order to get more out of the workshop, I had to talk more about race, even if it was uncomfortable, and that meant that I had to talk openly an honestly about my own whiteness. So on the next day of the workshop, that’s what I did: I opened up more, offered more candid thoughts and stories, leaned into the discomfort of talking about race. When I picked up Debby Irving’s book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20665987-waking-up-white"><em>Waking Up White</em></a>, it felt like a refresher course extending the inner work I began during that workshop. Here was another white anti-racist educator proclaiming loudly to her readers: “I’m white, and I’ve been really ignorant about race, but I’m leaning into my discomfort because it’s what white people have to do.”</p>

<p>Even if you haven’t been involved in workshops designed to facilitate discussion across lines of difference or interrogate white privilege, <em>Waking Up White</em> is a great resource for anyone open to the idea that dismantling racism is a critically important thing we have to do in the United States. The whole book is rife with observations that resonated with me, among them the idea that admitting that I’m part of a racist society doesn’t mean I’m a bad person. It’s the necessary first step to doing something about a giant, oppressive system that’s made up of individual actions, including my own. As Irving puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can racism possibly be dismantled until white people, lots and lots of white people, understand it as an unfair system, get in touch with the subtle stories and stereotypes that play in their heads, and see themselves not as good or bad but as players in the system? (p 153).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 46 short chapters in the book each function as little workshop modules unto themselves: Irving shares a personal story, offers some historical or social analysis, and closes with a discussion question to allow the reader to dig deeper into the personal work. My hardcopy is covered with underlining and notes, but a few of the big concepts are often on my mind whenever I’m thinking and talking about race.</p>

<h2 id="headwinds-and-tailwinds">Headwinds and tailwinds</h2>

<p>Irving uses the metaphor of “headwinds” for those regular, daily microagressions, biases, and slights that make life harder for citizens of color in the United States. “Tailwinds,” on the other hand, are the invisible pushes and nudges that help white folks continue sailing smoothly through life—the “invisible knapsack” of privileges that I often don’t realize I have. The metaphor resonates with me because “headwinds” are so noticeable, literally in your face, while “tailwinds” are so easy to forget about.</p>

<p>Some headwinds are the result of overt bias in social interactions, or frustrating microagressions; others are massive, state-organized historical injustices. For example, one historical headwind/tailwind that Irving discusses is the GI Bill, which granted college tuition and low-cost home loans to white veterans after WW II, but that was implemented in such a way that excluded black families, who couldn’t benefit from the wealth-building programs. “From the perspective of American excluded from this massive leg-up policy, the GI Bill is one of the best examples of affirmative action for white people,” she writes (p 35).</p>

<p>And it’s not as if headwinds vanish once you know they’re there. Irving writes: “as long as our racial system is intact, there’s nothing I can do to give away my privilege. I’ve got it, whether I want it or not. The question is what will I <em>do</em> with it” (p 74).</p>

<h2 id="dominant-culture-emotions-or-lack-thereof">Dominant culture emotions (or lack thereof)</h2>

<p>Irving grew up in an upper-middle-class WASP family in New England, where politeness and cheeriness were core virtues, and everyone avoided conflict by suppressing and never discussing their emotions. I grew up in the south, rather than the north, but her descriptions of a dominant white culture that stuffed away feelings in order to keep everything on an even keel struck home. “Rather than face feelings like anger, embarrassment, or guilt head-on, my first reaction usually involved an urge to run, defend myself, blame someone, or have a stiff drink,” she writes (p 166).</p>

<p>Structural racism hurts and generates raw, palpable emotions for people of color. Because of my whiteness, and the fact that I’ve been trained to avoid raw emotions in many public and professional situations, it’s long been my response to shy away from the discomfort of talking about race. Part of understanding my own whiteness has been recognizing and naming these elements of dominant white culture like defensiveness, emotional restraint, and conflict avoidance. Knowing those elements of the dominant culture, and seeing them as part of my own upbringing, has allowed me to lean into more difficult conversations about race.</p>

<h2 id="leaning-into-discomfort">Leaning into discomfort</h2>

<p>Irving’s book has reminded me that when I start talking about a race-related topic and my blood pressure goes up, or my skin turns red, that’s a sign I need to keep talking, rather than shy away from the issue. There are so many potential “detours” that I, or other white folks, can turn to in discussions of race: acting “colorblind” (which erases the lived experience of people of color), calling something “reverse racism” (which denies the power imbalance inherent in racism, which is prejudice + power), treating an instance of racism as an isolated incident (when many people of color experience headwinds and microaggressions regularly).</p>

<p>This book helped to solidify for me what working for racial equity looks like: it starts with personal work understanding my own self, and how I have fit into the larger systems of structural racism in the U.S. I didn’t build those systems, and I certainly don’t endorse them, but I’ve accepted I’m a part of them and can work to dismantle them. That’s where I think my work as a white, anti-racist ally beings. “Seeing myself <em>in</em> a system <em>with</em> people as opposed to a sympathetic observer on the sidelines changed my relationship to the problem,” writes Irving. “I understood then that it was possible to be both a good person and complicit in a corrupt system” (p 99).</p>
</span>-->
        <p>
        
          I was at a two-day race and equity workshop last fall, and during the final session of the first day, the lead facilitator read aloud several pieces of anonymous feedback that various participants had shared. “I want to hear more from the white participants,” she said, reading from a card someone else had submitted. Hearing that, something clicked for me: I was listening to the participants of color talk about race, and I was empathizing with their stories, thoughts, and emotions, but I wasn’t talking enough about my own race, my own story, and my own emotions. That withholding was, in fact, a facet of my own white privilege. The skin I was in meant that I didn’t have to think about race on a day-to-day basis if I didn’t want to. In order to get more out of the workshop, I had to talk more about race, even if it was uncomfortable, and that meant that I had to talk openly an honestly about my own whiteness. So on the next day of the workshop, that’s what I did: I opened up more, offered more candid thoughts and stories, leaned into the discomfort of talking about race. When I picked up Debby Irving’s book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20665987-waking-up-white"><em>Waking Up White</em></a>, it felt like a refresher course extending the inner work I began during that workshop. Here was another white anti-racist educator proclaiming loudly to her readers: “I’m white, and I’ve been really ignorant about race, but I’m leaning into my discomfort because it’s what white people have to do.”

<p>There are two books sitting on my bedside shelf that I
have been reading in short chunks for a long time. One is <em>The Evolution of Childhood</em> by Melvin Konner. The other is <em>The Richness of Life</em>, acollection of essays and book excerpts by Stephen Jay Gould. One is
essentially a textbook; the other is full of stories. Both are great
books about science in their own right. I’ll eventually make it through
each. But which one will a remember better? Will I learn more from the
expository text or the narrative essays?</p>

<p>Probably the one with the stories, and there’s research to support that
hypothesis. Prof. Daniel Willingham at UVa <a href="http://www.danielwillingham.com/1/post/2013/06/storify-make-science-tell-a-story.html">writes on his blog about a
new paper</a> explaining an experiment with middle school students
reading two different science texts on Galileo or Marie Curie.</p>

<p>Students read either a straightforward expository text about the work of
one scientist or the other, <em>or</em> the students read a narrative text
explaining Curie’s of Galileo’s work. The students who read the story
<a href="http://www.danielwillingham.com/1/post/2013/06/storify-make-science-tell-a-story.html">retained more information</a>
shortly after the reading and then again when tested a week later.</p>

<p>This is an interesting finding in and of itself, but Willingham pushes
things further, arguing, “I’d like to broaden the view of ‘narrative’”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You don’t have to think of narrative just as the story of an
individual or group of people; you can think more abstractly conflict,
complications, and the eventual resolution of conflict as the core of
narrative structure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this formulation, narrative structure becomes <a href="http://www.appratt.com/2012/09/reading-and-scheming/">a schema for
organizing information</a>. If a scientific story needs characters,
conflict, complications, and resolution, then scientists are the
characters, the problem or question is the conflict, complications and
rising action are the fabric of the experimental process, and the
resolution is what a scientist learns.</p>

<p>But I couldn’t read Willingham’s synthesis and not think about the
teacher professional development I’ve been doing recently. Much of the
PD that I’ve created is purely expository: here are the ideas, the
definitions, the information. But if explaining an education program
requires generating a schema with which teachers can organize
information, then perhaps a story of how an instructional approach was
developed or worked in a real classroom would be the stronger approach.
At the very least, it would likely mean more entertaining professional
development time; I’d rather tell a story than just flip through slides.</p>

<p>Bret Victor wrote an essay in 2012 that left me desperately wishing I
were a computer engineer. <a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/">“Learnable Programming”</a> was a critique of
1) Khan Academy’s newly released intro course on programming, 2) the
Processing language the course focused on, and 3) decades of stagnation
in programming pedagogy. The essay was funny, visually stunning,
provocative, and so convincing in its presentation of an effective
foundation for how to teach programming to learners by <em>showing them
what their code was actually doing</em> that one could easily be led to
believe that anyone who’d even considered the question of how to teach
programming before was asleep at the pedagogical wheel. The intellectual
effect was something akin to a first encounter with Edward Tufte’s
suggestion that graphs should show information instead of junky
non-information. It was brilliant in a way that makes your temples burn
and your mouth keep murmuring, “Yes. Yes. Yes!” Computers are awesome.
Education is awesome. Teaching students how to do powerful things with
computers = Best. Thing. Ever.</p>

<p>Ergo, I desperately wished that I knew enough about programming to join
whatever project Victor was about to suggest.</p>

<p>Pivotal to the essay was the (brief) intellectual history of older
languages and computer environments explicitly designed to teach
students about programming. In this, Victor was unequivocal on the
importance of <em>Mindstorms</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The canonical work on designing programming systems for learning, and
perhaps the greatest book ever written on learning in general, is
Seymour Papert’s ‘Mindstorms.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given the brainy rush induced by Victor’s essay, I had no other choice
than to follow his direct instructions, “For fuck’s sake, read
‘Mindstorms.’” So I ordered a used copy within minutes of reaching the
bottom of his article.</p>

<p><em>Mindstorms</em> was published in 1980, while Papert worked at MIT, so he
uses terms like “cybernetics” in earnest and offers astounding facts
like “in the past two years, over 200,000 personal computers have
entered the lives of Americans” (p 181). So in that sense, the jargon
and computational enthusiasm resonates with Tracy Kidder’s <em>The Soul of
a New Machine.</em>(I.e. it’s very dated, but remember that you’re reading
this for history and theory.) Now set this in concert with Papert’s
vision for the role of computers in building learning environments for
children: it is grounded firmly in his years of work with developmental
psychologist Jean Piaget, a pioneer of constructivist education theory.
The “build it yourself” and “ask lots of questions” spirit resonates
with my 80s memories of LEGO sets and Sesame Street. Taken together,
Papert’s ideas, read three decades later, crystalize for me a certain
utopian fetish for the intellectual, cultural, and political
possibilities of kids screwing around with boxy, green-screened Apple
IIes.</p>

<p>But on a more practical level, the book is full of clear-eyed
distillations of how tinkering with computers can help teachers and
students make thinking visible. Take, for instance, Papert’s ideas here
about the pedagogical power of “debugging” a computer program as a
special case of tenacious learning-by-experiment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The question to ask about the program is not whether it is right or
wrong, but if it is fixable. If this way of looking at intellectual
products were generalized to how the larger culture thinks about
knowledge and its acquisition, we all might be less intimidated by our
fears of “being wrong.” This potential influence of the computer on
changing our notion of a black and white version of our successes and
failures is an example of using the computer as an
“object-to-think-with.” It is obviously not necessary to work with
computers in order to acquire good strategies for learning. Surely
“debugging” strategies were developed by successful learners long
before computers existed. But thinking about learning by analogy with
developing a program is a powerful and accessible way to get started
on becoming more articulate about one’s debugging strategies and more
deliberate about improving them (p 23).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thirty years on, there’s a <a href="http://www.code.org/learn/scratch">profusion</a> of non-profits, projects, and
start-ups trying to teach kids and adults alike to code. But what often
goes unstated in the breathlessness about how <em>cool</em> it is to learn how
to code is that fact that learning to code is, like learning to read and
write, an extension of learning how to think. And learning how to think
requires learning how to be “metacognitive”–that is, able to think
about how your own ideas and thought processes work, so that you can
find problems and correct them.</p>

<p>The LOGO interface allows users to draw using simple commands. Here’s
one way to draw a square:</p>

<blockquote>
  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> FORWARD 100
 RIGHT 90
 FORWARD 100
 RIGHT 90
 FORWARD 100
 RIGHT 90
 FORWARD 100
 RIGHT 90
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>This code it easy enough to decipher: go forward 100 units, turn right
90 degrees, repeat 4 times, and you’ve drawn 4 straight sides at right
angles to one another.</p>

<p>But I believe that part of Victor’s fascination with LOGO as a teaching
tool lies in the simple metaphor of the Turtle. The Turtle is the stylus
implied in the lines of code above. In LOGO, the “cursor” that moves
around the screen, drawing your square (or whatever other shape) is
called the “Turtle,” and all the written commands in the code are simply
instructions to the Turtle for where to go and what to do. The Turtle is
a little metaphor that helps to crystalize the fact that writing an
effective program is nothing more than figuring out how to provide a
cute, determined animal with the right set of instructions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.appratt.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/turtle_basics.png"><img src="http://www.appratt.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/turtle_basics.png" alt="LOGO turtle basic commands" /></a><br />
(<a href="http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/logo/turtle.html">Screengrab from the LOGO Foundation site</a>)</p>

<p>But here’s were things get cooler. Papert’s team didn’t just build LOGO
software and use it to help students experiment with mathematical
principals while drawing shapes on green computer screens. The were also
real Turtles students could control using the <strong>exact same
instructions</strong>. These real Turtles were dome-shaped motorized robots
with retractable styluses in them that would draw programed shapes and
images on swaths of paper laid out on the classroom floor.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.appratt.com/images/mindstorms_turtle.jpg" alt="two young students with a LOGO turtle" /></p>

<p>(<a href="http://www.bfoit.org/Intro_to_Programming/IntroCmds.html">Image from bfoit.org</a>)</p>

<p>The link between the simple mathematics of a computer program and the
real images a student could create is a perfect example of
constructivist learning. Tinker with something abstract, see the results in the real world. Repeat over and over and the learner’s understanding improves.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the conceptual link between the instructions a student
writes in a computer program and the visual results of that code is
another fundamental element of how students learn. “An important part of becoming a good learner is learning how to push out the frontier of what we can express with words,” Papert writes (p 96). Essentially, he’s arguing that part of expanding what a student knows is forcing them to encounter the edges of their explanatory powers: the link between code
and image is itself pushing that expansion. When a student’s words are
insufficient to explain what he or she knows, a key element of the
learning process is acquiring new words, new concepts, and new grammars
to explain it. And when there is such an intimate link between the new
words (code) and the concepts they express (the program output), the
boundaries of what the student can express expand.</p>

<p>The illustrate this point, consider another example from the LOGO
Foundation’s web page introducing the basics of the language. After
explaining foundational concepts like how to draw a line and a square,
the example introduces how to combine and repeat instructions to create
a picture made by iterating a a drawing of a square over and over on top
of itself, creating a pinwheel design that is difficult to describe in
pure words, but which explodes onto the screen with just a few lines of
code:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.appratt.com/images/vocabulary.png" alt="screen grab from LOGO foundation site explaining how to iterate with
LOGO code" /></p>

<p>(<a href="http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/logo/turtle.html">Screen grab from LOGO foundation site.</a>)</p>

<p>Papert’s walks through several different analogies for how computational
thinking can illuminate instructional situations. There’s an extended
discussion of how learning to juggle is a process of
“debugging”–correcting many small isolated errors to get a sequence of
actions to work. There’s explanations of how computer environments to
shape better physics instruction that helps students make connections
between physical principles and their own experience of objects in the
world–as opposed to simply forcing them to encounter physics through a
set of abstract equations. But he also anticipates criticism of this
push for teaching “computational thinking” with a powerful argument for
how it expands cognitive ability:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my view a salient feature of human intelligence is the ability to
operate with many ways of knowing, often in parallel, so that
something can be understood on many levels. In my experience, the fact
that I ask myself to ‘think like a computer’ does not close off other
epistemologies. It simply opens new ways for approaching thinking. …
But true computer literacy is not just knowing how to make use of
computer and computational ideas. It is knowing when it is appropriate
to do so (p 155).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And perhaps most importantly, Papert believes that the process of
learning computational thinking is necessarily a <em>social</em> process that
facilitates and depends upon the interplay between student, learning
objective, and teacher. Again, the process of debugging is powerful
because it re-writes concepts about what it means to be “wrong” and
helps students think metacognitively, but it also creates questions and
topics of conversation for student/teacher interactions, where the
student practices pushing out the frontiers of what he or she can
express with words.</p>

<p>“In my vision the computer acts as a transitional object to mediate
relationships that are ultimately between person and person,” Papert
writes in one of the concluding chapters (p 183). In this case, Victor’s
essay on Learnable Programming did just that: a maze of networked
computers served up his ideas and enthusiasm for <em>Mindstorms</em>, and
hopefully I’ve been able to capture some of that excitement for you,
dear reader, on your computer.</p>

<p>I love talking to people about the exciting work they’re doing. I love
it more when their work resonates with something I’m doing. I love it
the most when finding people whose exciting work resonates with my own
is part of my professional responsibilities.</p>

<p>While teaching, I realized that the willingness to ask people to share
their thoughts or products or expertise wasn’t just stimulating for
me–it actually helped me do better work and allowed me to be a bridge
between otherwise unconnected people doing work that resonated.
Essentially, alongside teaching, I started doing a lot of networking.
Just by asking, I got to beta test products like ShowMe and ThreeRing
and ClassDojo to support my students. Just by email-introducing two
people, I connected edtech startups building data tools with researchers
looking for data.</p>

<p>Connecting with others working in education and education technology
started to seem like more than just a way to make me a better teacher
and keep myself intellectually stimulated–it started to seem like a
necessary and important part of working in education and technology.
That’s why danah boyd’s distillation of <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/talks/2013/ASTD2013.html">networking similarities between
startup employees and teens</a> struck me as particularly astute
(emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Networks of people are being mediated such that people are easily able
to see who is connected to whom and leverage loose ties to achieve all
sorts of work-related goals.<strong>Individual knowledge is often less
important than being connected to the right people. And technology
makes a lot of this easier. Social networks aren’t technologies.
They’re relationships between people.</strong> And those relationships might
be mediated through technology, but it’s the relationships that matter
more than the technology. Success in today’s workforce isn’t simply
about having hard skills; it’s about being networked in all sense of
the word.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The point about connections over individual knowledge takes me right to
another current intellectual obsession: the problem-solving power of
diverse groups. Scott Page is an economist whose research demonstrates
that collaboration among a diverse set of problem solvers yields more
potential approaches to tackling complex problems than collaboration
among homogenous groups. Now, having a strong social network does
not guarantee that you’ll be able to leverage it to solve complex
problems. Having a network at also doesn’t mean that your network can
solve problems in the first place. But working on complex problems (like
many in education), I think that doing good work depends upon having a
strong network.</p>
