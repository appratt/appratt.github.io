## Music

- Write and record a song
- Tackle a challenging piece of piano music like "I Wish That I Knew How It Would Feel To Be Free" or "Turkish March." Though both of those are examples of pieces that I've learned part of over the course of years and then moved on.
- Learn a variety of less complex songs
- Practice guitar: get at least to a point where I can play all the major and minor chords, so that I approach any song.
- Find a music teacher and take a few lessons (this isn't happening)
- Research and practice a method for continuing to engage P's interest in learning piano, continuing what she learned in music at school
