    <p>Hi—Andrew here. I’m a white anti-racist ally and a Director of School Launch and Incubation at <a href="http://citybridge.org">CityBridge Education</a> in Washington, D.C. My work is grounded in the belief that schools are institutions that can either teach and reinforce racism and bias, or that can disrupt and dismantle systems of oppression. I work with teams building the disruptive schools.</p>

<p>At CityBridge, I coach and advise school entrepreneurs designing new models for public schools in D.C. Formerly, I co-designed and co-led the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T8jA80ibQHsDg73uc_qyMboCNWxWz1AVmgzBB2GbCSs/edit">Breakthrough Design Fellowship</a>, which merged the consciousness of racial equity work with the creativity of design thinking. I also co-led multiple cohorts of <a href="http://schoolretool.org/">School Retool</a> and coached leaders and teams on the strategy and change management necessary for school redesign. From 2015-2016, I led the <a href="https://edinnovationdc.org/fellowship/">CityBridge Education Innovation Fellowship</a>.</p>

<p>As a white man working in education, I firmly believe that doing this work requires me to acknowledge the skin I’m in and to use the privilege I have in American society to work for educational justice—more on that in <a href="http://appratt.com/2016/08/17/waking-up-white-review/">this post</a>.</p>

<p><a id="bio-extended"></a>I’m an alum of the 4.0 Schools Essentials training; I am a 2018 Summit Learning <a href="https://www.summitlearning.org/partners">Certified Support Partner</a> for school leader coaching; I’m a member of the Transcend Education <a href="http://www.transcendeducation.org/yellow-hats/">Yellow Hats League</a>; and I’m certified in teaching the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=11LVHeZYvPoAWeu7pibCmgifjjXDVAUVi">equityXdesign framework</a>.</p>

<p>I was formerly the Deputy Director of School Partnerships at <a href="http://newclassrooms.org/">New Classrooms Innovation Partners</a>, where worked I with schools in three states and the District of Columbia to implement the Teach To One: Math personalized learning program.</p>

<p>I began my career in education as a Teach For America corps member in Prince George’s County, Maryland, teaching 7th-grade English/Language Arts. Before that, I worked at the intersection of science, communications, and public policy as the founding Managing Editor of <a href="http://scienceprogress.org/">ScienceProgress.org</a>.</p>
