        <h2>Hi! Andrew Plemmons Pratt here.</h2>
        <p>I'm Director of School Launch and Incubation at <a href="http://citybridge.org">CityBridge Education</a> in Washington, D.C., where I lead the Design Fellowship. The Fellowship weaves together human-centered design and race equity tools to support educators designing and testing new solutions to challenges facing public schools.</p>

        <p>My work is grounded in the anti-racist belief that equitable schools can disrupt and dismantle systems of oppression. At CityBridge, I have: coached school entrepreneurs on the development of successful charter applications; co-designed and co-led the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T8jA80ibQHsDg73uc_qyMboCNWxWz1AVmgzBB2GbCSs/edit">Breakthrough Design Fellowship</a>, which merged the consciousness of racial equity work with the creativity of design thinking; co-led local <a href="http://schoolretool.org/">School Retool</a> cohorts; and led the <a href="https://edinnovationdc.org/fellowship/">Education Innovation Fellowship</a>.</p>

        <p>Before joining CityBridge, I was Deputy Director of School Partnerships at <a href="https://www.newclassrooms.org/">New Classrooms</a>; I taught seventh grade English as a Teach For America corps member in Prince George’s County, Maryland; and I was the founding Managing Editor of ScienceProgress.org at the Center for American Progress. I hold a B.A. in English and American studies and an M.A. in English, both from the University of Virginia.</p>

        <p>As a white man working in education, I firmly believe that doing this work requires me to acknowledge the skin I'm in and to use the privilege I have in American society to work for educational justice—more on that in <a href="http://www.appratt.com/2016/08/17/waking-up-white-review/">this post</a>.
