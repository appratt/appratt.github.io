<p>I love talking to people about the exciting work they’re doing. I love
it more when their work resonates with something I’m doing. I love it
the most when finding people whose exciting work resonates with my own
is part of my professional responsibilities.</p>

<p>While teaching, I realized that the willingness to ask people to share
their thoughts or products or expertise wasn’t just stimulating for
me–it actually helped me do better work and allowed me to be a bridge
between otherwise unconnected people doing work that resonated.
Essentially, alongside teaching, I started doing a lot of networking.
Just by asking, I got to beta test products like ShowMe and ThreeRing
and ClassDojo to support my students. Just by email-introducing two
people, I connected edtech startups building data tools with researchers
looking for data.</p>

<p>Connecting with others working in education and education technology
started to seem like more than just a way to make me a better teacher
and keep myself intellectually stimulated–it started to seem like a
necessary and important part of working in education and technology.
That’s why danah boyd’s distillation of <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/talks/2013/ASTD2013.html">networking similarities between
startup employees and teens</a> struck me as particularly astute
(emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Networks of people are being mediated such that people are easily able
to see who is connected to whom and leverage loose ties to achieve all
sorts of work-related goals.<strong>Individual knowledge is often less
important than being connected to the right people. And technology
makes a lot of this easier. Social networks aren’t technologies.
They’re relationships between people.</strong> And those relationships might
be mediated through technology, but it’s the relationships that matter
more than the technology. Success in today’s workforce isn’t simply
about having hard skills; it’s about being networked in all sense of
the word.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The point about connections over individual knowledge takes me right to
another current intellectual obsession: the problem-solving power of
diverse groups. Scott Page is an economist whose research demonstrates
that collaboration among a diverse set of problem solvers yields more
potential approaches to tackling complex problems than collaboration
among homogenous groups. Now, having a strong social network does
not guarantee that you’ll be able to leverage it to solve complex
problems. Having a network at also doesn’t mean that your network can
solve problems in the first place. But working on complex problems (like
many in education), I think that doing good work depends upon having a
strong network.</p>
