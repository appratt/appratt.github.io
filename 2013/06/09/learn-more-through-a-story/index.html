<p>There are two books sitting on my bedside shelf that I
have been reading in short chunks for a long time. One is <em>The Evolution of Childhood</em> by Melvin Konner. The other is <em>The Richness of Life</em>, acollection of essays and book excerpts by Stephen Jay Gould. One is
essentially a textbook; the other is full of stories. Both are great
books about science in their own right. I’ll eventually make it through
each. But which one will a remember better? Will I learn more from the
expository text or the narrative essays?</p>

<p>Probably the one with the stories, and there’s research to support that
hypothesis. Prof. Daniel Willingham at UVa <a href="http://www.danielwillingham.com/1/post/2013/06/storify-make-science-tell-a-story.html">writes on his blog about a
new paper</a> explaining an experiment with middle school students
reading two different science texts on Galileo or Marie Curie.</p>

<p>Students read either a straightforward expository text about the work of
one scientist or the other, <em>or</em> the students read a narrative text
explaining Curie’s of Galileo’s work. The students who read the story
<a href="http://www.danielwillingham.com/1/post/2013/06/storify-make-science-tell-a-story.html">retained more information</a>
shortly after the reading and then again when tested a week later.</p>

<p>This is an interesting finding in and of itself, but Willingham pushes
things further, arguing, “I’d like to broaden the view of ‘narrative’”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You don’t have to think of narrative just as the story of an
individual or group of people; you can think more abstractly conflict,
complications, and the eventual resolution of conflict as the core of
narrative structure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this formulation, narrative structure becomes <a href="http://www.appratt.com/2012/09/reading-and-scheming/">a schema for
organizing information</a>. If a scientific story needs characters,
conflict, complications, and resolution, then scientists are the
characters, the problem or question is the conflict, complications and
rising action are the fabric of the experimental process, and the
resolution is what a scientist learns.</p>

<p>But I couldn’t read Willingham’s synthesis and not think about the
teacher professional development I’ve been doing recently. Much of the
PD that I’ve created is purely expository: here are the ideas, the
definitions, the information. But if explaining an education program
requires generating a schema with which teachers can organize
information, then perhaps a story of how an instructional approach was
developed or worked in a real classroom would be the stronger approach.
At the very least, it would likely mean more entertaining professional
development time; I’d rather tell a story than just flip through slides.</p>
