<p>Bret Victor wrote an essay in 2012 that left me desperately wishing I
were a computer engineer. <a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/">“Learnable Programming”</a> was a critique of
1) Khan Academy’s newly released intro course on programming, 2) the
Processing language the course focused on, and 3) decades of stagnation
in programming pedagogy. The essay was funny, visually stunning,
provocative, and so convincing in its presentation of an effective
foundation for how to teach programming to learners by <em>showing them
what their code was actually doing</em> that one could easily be led to
believe that anyone who’d even considered the question of how to teach
programming before was asleep at the pedagogical wheel. The intellectual
effect was something akin to a first encounter with Edward Tufte’s
suggestion that graphs should show information instead of junky
non-information. It was brilliant in a way that makes your temples burn
and your mouth keep murmuring, “Yes. Yes. Yes!” Computers are awesome.
Education is awesome. Teaching students how to do powerful things with
computers = Best. Thing. Ever.</p>

<p>Ergo, I desperately wished that I knew enough about programming to join
whatever project Victor was about to suggest.</p>

<p>Pivotal to the essay was the (brief) intellectual history of older
languages and computer environments explicitly designed to teach
students about programming. In this, Victor was unequivocal on the
importance of <em>Mindstorms</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The canonical work on designing programming systems for learning, and
perhaps the greatest book ever written on learning in general, is
Seymour Papert’s ‘Mindstorms.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given the brainy rush induced by Victor’s essay, I had no other choice
than to follow his direct instructions, “For fuck’s sake, read
‘Mindstorms.’” So I ordered a used copy within minutes of reaching the
bottom of his article.</p>

<p><em>Mindstorms</em> was published in 1980, while Papert worked at MIT, so he
uses terms like “cybernetics” in earnest and offers astounding facts
like “in the past two years, over 200,000 personal computers have
entered the lives of Americans” (p 181). So in that sense, the jargon
and computational enthusiasm resonates with Tracy Kidder’s <em>The Soul of
a New Machine.</em>(I.e. it’s very dated, but remember that you’re reading
this for history and theory.) Now set this in concert with Papert’s
vision for the role of computers in building learning environments for
children: it is grounded firmly in his years of work with developmental
psychologist Jean Piaget, a pioneer of constructivist education theory.
The “build it yourself” and “ask lots of questions” spirit resonates
with my 80s memories of LEGO sets and Sesame Street. Taken together,
Papert’s ideas, read three decades later, crystalize for me a certain
utopian fetish for the intellectual, cultural, and political
possibilities of kids screwing around with boxy, green-screened Apple
IIes.</p>

<p>But on a more practical level, the book is full of clear-eyed
distillations of how tinkering with computers can help teachers and
students make thinking visible. Take, for instance, Papert’s ideas here
about the pedagogical power of “debugging” a computer program as a
special case of tenacious learning-by-experiment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The question to ask about the program is not whether it is right or
wrong, but if it is fixable. If this way of looking at intellectual
products were generalized to how the larger culture thinks about
knowledge and its acquisition, we all might be less intimidated by our
fears of “being wrong.” This potential influence of the computer on
changing our notion of a black and white version of our successes and
failures is an example of using the computer as an
“object-to-think-with.” It is obviously not necessary to work with
computers in order to acquire good strategies for learning. Surely
“debugging” strategies were developed by successful learners long
before computers existed. But thinking about learning by analogy with
developing a program is a powerful and accessible way to get started
on becoming more articulate about one’s debugging strategies and more
deliberate about improving them (p 23).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thirty years on, there’s a <a href="http://www.code.org/learn/scratch">profusion</a> of non-profits, projects, and
start-ups trying to teach kids and adults alike to code. But what often
goes unstated in the breathlessness about how <em>cool</em> it is to learn how
to code is that fact that learning to code is, like learning to read and
write, an extension of learning how to think. And learning how to think
requires learning how to be “metacognitive”–that is, able to think
about how your own ideas and thought processes work, so that you can
find problems and correct them.</p>

<p>The LOGO interface allows users to draw using simple commands. Here’s
one way to draw a square:</p>

<blockquote>
  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> FORWARD 100
 RIGHT 90
 FORWARD 100
 RIGHT 90
 FORWARD 100
 RIGHT 90
 FORWARD 100
 RIGHT 90
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>This code it easy enough to decipher: go forward 100 units, turn right
90 degrees, repeat 4 times, and you’ve drawn 4 straight sides at right
angles to one another.</p>

<p>But I believe that part of Victor’s fascination with LOGO as a teaching
tool lies in the simple metaphor of the Turtle. The Turtle is the stylus
implied in the lines of code above. In LOGO, the “cursor” that moves
around the screen, drawing your square (or whatever other shape) is
called the “Turtle,” and all the written commands in the code are simply
instructions to the Turtle for where to go and what to do. The Turtle is
a little metaphor that helps to crystalize the fact that writing an
effective program is nothing more than figuring out how to provide a
cute, determined animal with the right set of instructions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.appratt.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/turtle_basics.png"><img src="http://www.appratt.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/turtle_basics.png" alt="LOGO turtle basic commands" /></a><br />
(<a href="http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/logo/turtle.html">Screengrab from the LOGO Foundation site</a>)</p>

<p>But here’s were things get cooler. Papert’s team didn’t just build LOGO
software and use it to help students experiment with mathematical
principals while drawing shapes on green computer screens. The were also
real Turtles students could control using the <strong>exact same
instructions</strong>. These real Turtles were dome-shaped motorized robots
with retractable styluses in them that would draw programed shapes and
images on swaths of paper laid out on the classroom floor.</p>

<p>(<a href="http://www.bfoit.org/Intro_to_Programming/IntroCmds.html">Image from bfoit.org</a>)</p>

<p>The link between the simple mathematics of a computer program and the
real images a student could create is a perfect example of
constructivist learning. Tinker with something abstract, see the results in the real world. Repeat over and over and the learner’s understanding improves.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the conceptual link between the instructions a student
writes in a computer program and the visual results of that code is
another fundamental element of how students learn. “An important part of becoming a good learner is learning how to push out the frontier of what we can express with words,” Papert writes (p 96). Essentially, he’s arguing that part of expanding what a student knows is forcing them to encounter the edges of their explanatory powers: the link between code
and image is itself pushing that expansion. When a student’s words are
insufficient to explain what he or she knows, a key element of the
learning process is acquiring new words, new concepts, and new grammars
to explain it. And when there is such an intimate link between the new
words (code) and the concepts they express (the program output), the
boundaries of what the student can express expand.</p>

<p>The illustrate this point, consider another example from the LOGO
Foundation’s web page introducing the basics of the language. After
explaining foundational concepts like how to draw a line and a square,
the example introduces how to combine and repeat instructions to create
a picture made by iterating a a drawing of a square over and over on top
of itself, creating a pinwheel design that is difficult to describe in
pure words, but which explodes onto the screen with just a few lines of
code:</p>

LOGO code" /></p>

<p>(<a href="http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/logo/turtle.html">Screen grab from LOGO foundation site.</a>)</p>

<p>Papert’s walks through several different analogies for how computational
thinking can illuminate instructional situations. There’s an extended
discussion of how learning to juggle is a process of
“debugging”–correcting many small isolated errors to get a sequence of
actions to work. There’s explanations of how computer environments to
shape better physics instruction that helps students make connections
between physical principles and their own experience of objects in the
world–as opposed to simply forcing them to encounter physics through a
set of abstract equations. But he also anticipates criticism of this
push for teaching “computational thinking” with a powerful argument for
how it expands cognitive ability:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my view a salient feature of human intelligence is the ability to
operate with many ways of knowing, often in parallel, so that
something can be understood on many levels. In my experience, the fact
that I ask myself to ‘think like a computer’ does not close off other
epistemologies. It simply opens new ways for approaching thinking. …
But true computer literacy is not just knowing how to make use of
computer and computational ideas. It is knowing when it is appropriate
to do so (p 155).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And perhaps most importantly, Papert believes that the process of
learning computational thinking is necessarily a <em>social</em> process that
facilitates and depends upon the interplay between student, learning
objective, and teacher. Again, the process of debugging is powerful
because it re-writes concepts about what it means to be “wrong” and
helps students think metacognitively, but it also creates questions and
topics of conversation for student/teacher interactions, where the
student practices pushing out the frontiers of what he or she can
express with words.</p>

<p>“In my vision the computer acts as a transitional object to mediate
relationships that are ultimately between person and person,” Papert
writes in one of the concluding chapters (p 183). In this case, Victor’s
essay on Learnable Programming did just that: a maze of networked
computers served up his ideas and enthusiasm for <em>Mindstorms</em>, and
hopefully I’ve been able to capture some of that excitement for you,
dear reader, on your computer.</p>
