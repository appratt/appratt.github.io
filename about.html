        <h2>A little more about Andrew</h2>
        <p>I'm a Director of School Launch and Incubation at <a href="http://citybridge.org">CityBridge Education</a> in Washington, D.C., where I lead the School Design Fellowship. The Fellowship is a year-long experience for district and charter school leaders to think deeply and dream big about how school has to change in order to create a more equitable future.</p>

        <p>My work is grounded in the anti-racist belief that equitable schools can disrupt and dismantle systems of oppression. At CityBridge, I have: coached school entrepreneurs on the development of successful charter applications; co-designed and co-led the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T8jA80ibQHsDg73uc_qyMboCNWxWz1AVmgzBB2GbCSs/edit">Breakthrough Design Fellowship</a>, which merged the consciousness of racial equity work with the creativity of design thinking; co-led local <a href="http://schoolretool.org/">School Retool</a> cohorts; and led the <a href="https://edinnovationdc.org/fellowship/">Education Innovation Fellowship</a>.</p>

        <p>Before joining CityBridge, I was Deputy Director of School Partnerships at <a href="https://www.newclassrooms.org/">New Classrooms</a>; I taught seventh grade English as a Teach For America corps member in Prince George’s County, Maryland; and I was the founding Managing Editor of ScienceProgress.org at the Center for American Progress. I hold a B.A. in English and American studies and an M.A. in English, both from the University of Virginia.</p>

        <p>As a white man working in education, I firmly believe that doing this work requires me to acknowledge the skin I'm in and to use the privilege I have in American society to work for educational justice—more on that in <a href="./2016/08/17/waking-up-white-review/index.html">this post</a>.
        </p>

        <p><a id="bio-extended"></a>I’m an alum of the 4.0 Schools Essentials training; I am a Summit Learning <a href="https://www.summitlearning.org">Certified Support Partner</a> for school leader coaching; I’m a member of the Transcend Education <a href="http://www.transcendeducation.org/yellow-hats/">Yellow Hats League</a>; and I’m certified in teaching the <a href="http://www.228accelerator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/equityXdesign-11.14.16.pdf">equityXdesign framework</a>.</p>

        <p>While working at <a href="http://newclassrooms.org/">New Classrooms Innovation Partners</a>, I supported schools in three states and the District of Columbia to implement the Teach To One: Math personalized learning program.</p>

        <p>I began my career in education through TFA in Prince George’s County, teaching 7th-grade English/Language Arts. Before that, I helped build Science Progress, a magazine about progressive science and technology policy.</p>

        <p>When I'm not working with educators, you'll find me cooking with my kids, playing piano, running, reading, or tinkering with technologies old and new.</p>
